The girl and I were recently reminiscing on how woefully unqualified a majority of the teaching staff was at our public high school.  The cast of characters goes on and on.  There was the English teacher who was confused when I turned in an assignment with the word "through", since that was the olde timey spelling of "thru".  I had a teacher who Irished her coffee every afternoon.  Our principal fathered an illegitimate child who he ignored because he had special needs.  I had a morbidly obese math teacher who insisted the correct way to find the circumference of a circle was by using a piece of measured string.

Now that's not to say that all of the teachers were incompetent.  There were a few good ones that did genuinely care for their students and forwent better opportunities because they knew that they were improving the lives of children.

Anyways, the incompetence was reassuring.  These _adults_ can manage to feed themselves.  Being an adult.  How hard can it be?

But could I be a teacher?

Well, the public school system in the city where I grew up requires a master's degree for all high school teachers.  In other words, my bachelor's degree means that I would be unable to hold same position of the math teacher who knew of only one type of pie, the amateur mixologist or even the avant-garde grammaticist.

Now, if I did want to be a teacher (and that is actually something I would consider upon retirement), I'd need to have the credentials.  Our conversation concluded that I would in fact need to be rewarded an honorary degree.  And to get one of those, you need to give a commencement speech.  I could do that -- that's easy.  I could talk to a crowd about some pseudo-aspriation bullshit for a few minutes.  We ignored the fact that an achievement worthy of the honor would be required.

I challenged her to give me a topic -- any topic -- and I could come up with some bullshit on the spot.

Billiards.

It went something like this...

> Hello and welcome.  I'm here to talk to you about billiards.

I started with "hello and welcome" because I've been binge watching the [Engineering Explained][0] YouTube channel.  Oh, and I know nothing about billiards and I was hoping my opener would give me time to think.

> My first encounter with billiards was in the second grade.  Our, whom I expect needed a rest, wheeled in the TV cart to show us a video on how math can be fun!

Get 'em right in their hearts.  Everyone loves teachers.  They work so hard for so little pay, or so goes the narrative.  Of course they're tired!

> It was a Disney video that showed how geometry was used in playing billiards.  I found this video absolutely fascinating.  In fact, that's what made me want to play billiards.

I played pool once. The cueball went off the table and was lost under a radiator.

> And now I'm the world champion billiards player.

Is that a title someone can hold?  Is the a world champion billiardist? Billiardier?

Doesn't matter.  Now's a good time to break for an applause.

> If my second grade teacher hadn't shown us that video, I probably wouldn't have ever played billards. Who knows what'd I'd be doing.

> You're all going to become teachers. (Hold for applause.  Actually, step away from the podium and give a really cheese applause.)

Sometime during this whole thing I turned my fake audience into a group of future teachers who have just graduated with a masters in education.

> You will impact many lives.  While you're doing just that you're not going to realize it.  I know that my second grade teacher didn't set out to influence someone to be the world champion billiards player.

A textbook appeal to emotions.

There are two points to this post.  The first is that there is a different between ability and credentials.  Credentials are an indication of potential ability but don't necessarily imply that it exists.

The second is that given a position of authority, such as a keynote speaker, it's easy to appeal to emotions.  It's easy to persuade an audience.

That's why there are [imbeciles who support Bernie Sanders][1].
